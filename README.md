# Web-Crawler
Java SE Project

## Project Details
The project's main goal is to allow users scan or scrape websites for underlying details embedded in web pages. The application will employ the use of Java 1.8 SE Edition. A GUI application will sit on top of the web crawler which will allow users to quickly add URLs to a processing queue. This queue will allow users to scan multiple websites and addresses simultaneously. Usually a computer with two or more processor cores will process this queue fairly quickly.

## TODO
* Issue - Timeout error handling
* ToDo - List scroll function needs implementing
